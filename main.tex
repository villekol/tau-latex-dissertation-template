%% Congratulations, you've made an excellent choice
%% of writing your Tampere University dissertation using
%% the LaTeX system. This document attempts to be
%% as complete a template as possible to let you focus
%% on the most important part: the writing itself.
%% Thus the details regarding the visual appearance
%% have already been worked out for you!
%%
%% I sincerely hope you will find this template useful
%% in completing your dissertation project. I've tried to
%% add comments (followed by the % sign) to clarify
%% the structure and purpose of some of the commands.
%% Most of the magic happens in the file
%% taudissertation.cls, which you are more than welcome
%% to take a look at. Just refrain from editing it
%% in the most crucial versions of the dissertation!
%%
%% I wish you and your dissertation project the best
%% of luck! If this template causes you trouble along
%% the way or if you've any suggestions for improving it,
%% please be in contact through GitHub.
